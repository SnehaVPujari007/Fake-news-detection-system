# Fake News Detection System

## Overview
This project implements a Fake News Detection system using a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned for fake news detection. The system is designed to classify news articles as either "Fake" or "Real" based on the content provided. The model uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text and make predictions with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Text Classification**: Classifies news articles into fake or real categories.
- **Confidence Scores**: Outputs a confidence score for each classification, indicating the model's certainty.
- **Truncation Support**: Automatically truncates long articles to fit the model's maximum input length.
- **Easy Integration**: Can be integrated with other applications for automated fake news detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `transformers` library
- `pandas` library
- `torch` (PyTorch)

### Installation

To get started with the Fake News Detection System, you need to install the required dependencies. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers torch pandas
```

## Model Information

The model used in this project is a fine-tuned version of the BERT Tiny model specifically trained for fake news detection. It can classify short to medium-length news articles and generate a label (`'FAKE'` or `'REAL'`) along with a confidence score.

- **Model**: `mrm8488/bert-tiny-finetuned-fake-news-detection`
- **Library**: Hugging Face `transformers`
- **Framework**: PyTorch

## Performance

The model achieves good performance on fake news detection tasks, especially for short articles or summaries. However, it may struggle with long-form articles or texts with complex language patterns that deviate from typical news writing styles.

## Limitations

- The model may not perform well on highly ambiguous or context-dependent articles.
- The model's performance may degrade if the news content contains a lot of jargon or technical language that was not well-represented in the training data.
- The model has a maximum input length of 512 tokens; longer articles are truncated.

## Future Improvements

- **Data Augmentation**: Improve the model by training with more diverse datasets, including multilingual sources.
- **Long Text Support**: Implement strategies for handling longer articles more effectively.
- **Integration with News APIs**: Integrate the system with real-time news APIs to automatically classify articles from the web.
